I'm a proficient Front-End developer that loves writing Sass to compile and create beautiful layouts. I can easily adapt to any CSS framework required. Even though I definitly have an eye for design, and know how to use some basic Photoshop and Illustrator features, I wouldn't go so far as to consider myself a designer.

After a 3 months internship and 6 months of learning as a junior developer at Calibrate I have acquired some knowledge about Drupal site building, theming, module development and site administration.

In the past I have developed a few applications with Node.js, mainly using the MEN stack. I love the fact that all components of the stack support applications written in Javascript for both server-side and client-side execution environments.

Currently I'm learning more about the React Framework and would love to incorporate that into my stack (MERN-stack).
