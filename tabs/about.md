I'm a proficient Front-End developer that loves using SASS to compile and create beautiful layouts. I can easily adapt to any CSS framework required. I also know how to use Photoshop and Illustrator, even though I definetly have an eye for design,I wouldn't go so far as to consider myself a designer.

After a 3 months internship and 6 months of learning as a junior developer at Calibrate I have acquired some basic knowledge about Drupal site building, theming, module development and site administration.

In the past I have developed a few applications with Node.js, mainly using the MEN stack. I loved the fact that all components of the stack support applications written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.

I'm currently learing more about the React Framework and would love to incorporate that into my stack (MERN-stack).
